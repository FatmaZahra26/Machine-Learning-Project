# Machine-Learning-Project : "HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists"

🤖 In my Kaggle machine learning competition project, I worked on the "HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists" dataset. The objective was to predict among candidates who had passed interviews, who had an intention to join the company and who was seeking to join another company. This prediction was made to reduce training costs and plan candidate categorization.

🔍 To achieve this objective, I performed exploratory data analysis and selected the most important variables for the prediction model.

💻 Next, I applied various machine learning techniques to create a robust and accurate prediction model. I used algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and compared their performance using different metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and ROC.

📈 Finally, I evaluated the model on the test set and obtained satisfactory results. My model was able to accurately predict whether a candidate had the intention to join the company or not. This project demonstrated the importance of exploratory data analysis and selecting relevant variables for creating an accurate and robust prediction model.
